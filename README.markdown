Your challenge for the weekend:

Make a Rails app that responds to at least two routes:

[http://localhost:3000/am](http://localhost:3000/am "AM")

[http://localhost:3000/pm](http://localhost:3000/pm "PM")

The app should read from the same API as our Yearbook app did, (e.g., [http://tslwebdev.herokuapp.com/SECTION.json](http://tslwebdev.herokuapp.com/SECTION.json)) and generate appropriate responses for each request.
